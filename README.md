## Overview

This repository contains demonstration codes and data for students to use in IST 820. The problem is to detect DNS cache poisoning attacks with deep learning approaches. Data are provided in the "Data" directory, and four example models are provided in the "Model" directory. There exist four tasks:

- Task 1: Load the given models and data, and then evaluate the models' performances.

- Task 2: Train a model with given data. The training hyper-parameters are pre-set.

- Task 3: Tune hyper-parameters to improve the performances compared to models in Task 1 and 2.

- Task 4: Train traditional machine learning models for the same problem. In this demonstration, the random forest model is chosen.
